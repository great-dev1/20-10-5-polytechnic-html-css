        <a href="https://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/pizzetta-211-margherita-pizza"><b>Pizza</b></a>
        is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round,
        flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called
        a pizzetta.

        <a href="https://thewoksoflife.com/homemade-chinese-egg-noodles/"><b>Noodles</b></a>
        are a type of food made from unleavened dough which is rolled flat and cut, stretched or extruded, into long
        strips or strings. Noodles can be refrigerated for short-term storage or dried and stored for future use.
        Noodles are usually cooked in boiling water, sometimes with cooking oil or salt added.

        <a href="https://www.31daily.com/ratatouille/"><b>Ratatouille</b></a>
        is a French Provençal stewed vegetable dish, originating in Nice,
        and sometimes referred to as ratatouille niçoise. It's tangy, thanks to the sharpness of the tomatoes and
        peppers, the eggplant and squash are just sort of their usual spongy bland, taking on some of the tang of the
        acidics, and herbs, salt and pepper, and oil don't transform it into anything else.
